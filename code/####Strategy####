########
[x]Save tuning and validation results from previous workflow
[x]Make some basic RF and XGboost plots
[]Setup scripts to do additional workflow 
	[x] keep class probabilities
	[x] make null model for class predictions in training folds

#tune should be its own script, separate for RF and XGBOOST <- jk

[x] make sure first markdown works
[x] save tune and validation results
[1/2] make plots in markdown


[x] make sure to write down definitions for micro, macro, 
[] where did you get the data?
[x] n for taxa aggregation?
[x] null models?
[x] CURVES?

[] make short powerpoint re-explaining methods
[] make sure markdowns work
[] upload to github
